# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


#   song = Song.create(title: "Colors and Shapes", album: "Colors and Shapes", artist: "Mac Miller", year: 2021)
#  song = Song.create(title: "Baby Boy", album: "Awaken, My Love!", artist: "Childish Gambino", year: 2016)
#  song = Song.create(title: "Maria I'm Drunk", album: "Rodeo", artist: "Travis Scott", year: 2015)
